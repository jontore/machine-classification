## Feature selection
Using SelectKBest to find the best features, and evaluating them.
Also tried other such as SelectFwe which selects based on the family wise error rate however there is little or no difference, also SelectFpr selects based on false positive rate, and SelectFdr based on false positive rate. So simply select based on the highest score is sufficient.
